### SPACE CRIMINALS

Developed with SDL2.

Compile on Linux (assuming you have SDL2 installed):
g++ src/*.cpp -o space -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_mixer -lSDL2_ttf

Special thanks to:
Jerom - https://opengameart.org/users/jerom - for the 2D sprites
jeremysikes - https://freesound.org/people/jeremysykes/ - for the WAV sound effects

Music made by me.
